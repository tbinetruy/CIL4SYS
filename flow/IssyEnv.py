    States
        An observation is the set of positions, orientations, time spend idled,
        and speeds of the beta observed vehicles and the binary state of each
        RL controlled traffic lights along with how long ago each of the
        controlled intersections switched states.

    Actions
        See parent class

    Rewards
        The reward penalizes slow and/or emitting and/or idle time for the beta
        observable vehicles BUT does not penalize tl switches (as in IssyEnv2)

    Termination
        See parent class
