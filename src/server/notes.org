* Basic tensorflow server

Here is a prototype server for tensorflow projects.

** Dependencies

- python 3
- pip

** Usage
   
First, create a python 3 virtual environment to install our project's dependencies to:

#+begin_src bash
python -m venv venv
#+end_src

The activate the virtual environment:

#+begin_src bash
source venv/bin/activate
#+end_src

Install the dependencies (Flask and Tensorflow along with their dependencies):

#+begin_src bash
pip install requirements.txt
#+end_src

You can now start the server:

#+begin_src bash
./bin/start
#+end_src

Finally you can interact with it:

#+begin_src bash
./bin/test
#+end_src

** Notes

For now, the page just returns the result a stochastic matrix multiplication against a GET request. However, the idea is to quickly implement the POST request and integrate a SUMO trained reinforcement learning tensorflow model.
