    It currently only implements conversion for the sumo light state.
    This function returns the new state string (of the same length as the
    input state), this allows for handling intersections with different
    numbers of lanes and lights elegantly.

    This function takes any sumo light state but only convets to a "green"
    or "red" state. Orange and other states are converted accordingly, see
    implementation for more detail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    old_state: str
        Traffic light state string to invert.
    api: str
        Simulator API which defines the light state format to return.
        Currently only implements the sumo traffic state format.
        (see: https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation/Traffic_Lights#Signal_state_definitions)

    Returns
    ----------
    new_state: str
        New light state consisting of only red and green lights that
        oppose the previous state as much as possible.

def make_create_env(params, version=0, render=None):
    """Create a parametrized flow environment compatible with OpenAI gym.

    This is a slightly modified version of `flow.contrib.registry`'s
    make_create_env so we don't have to drop our environments and
    scenarios in Flow's modules. The original docstring is copied pasted
    bellow.

    This environment creation method allows for the specification of several
    key parameters when creating any flow environment, including the requested
    environment and scenario classes, and the inputs needed to make these
    classes generalizable to networks of varying sizes and shapes, and well as
    varying forms of control (e.g. AVs, automated traffic lights, etc...).

    This method can also be used to recreate the environment a policy was
    trained on and assess it performance, or a modified form of the previous
    environment may be used to profile the performance of the policy on other
    types of networks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    params : dict
        flow-related parameters, consisting of the following keys:

         - exp_tag: name of the experiment
         - env_name: name of the flow environment the experiment is running on
         - scenario: name of the scenario class the experiment uses
         - sim: simulation-related parameters (see flow.core.params.SimParams)
         - env: environment related parameters (see flow.core.params.EnvParams)
         - net: network-related parameters (see flow.core.params.NetParams and
           the scenario's documentation or ADDITIONAL_NET_PARAMS component)
         - veh: vehicles to be placed in the network at the start of a rollout
           (see flow.core.vehicles.Vehicles)
         - initial (optional): parameters affecting the positioning of vehicles
           upon initialization/reset (see flow.core.params.InitialConfig)
         - tls (optional): traffic lights to be introduced to specific nodes
           (see flow.core.params.TrafficLightParams)

    version : int, optional
        environment version number
    render : bool, optional
